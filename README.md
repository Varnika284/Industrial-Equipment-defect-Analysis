# Industrial-Equipment-defect-Analysis

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to classify images of industrial equipment as either 'defective' or 'non-defective.' Additionally, it includes labeling for specific defect types. The goal is to train and evaluate a robust model for identifying defects, leveraging classification metrics to assess performance.

# Project Structure
Notebook: Industrial Equipment Defect Detection.ipynb
Dataset: Contains images of industrial equipment with labeled categories (defective and non-defective) and sub-labels for defect types.

# Project Overview
The notebook includes the following steps:
Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset, ensuring accurate labels.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of images across classes and defect types.
Model Building:
Choose a suitable classification model (e.g., CNN for image classification).
Define model architecture.
Model Training: Train the model on the dataset, tuning hyperparameters for optimal results.
Evaluation: Assess the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Defect Type Classification: Additional classification for specific defect types, providing more granular insights.

# Usage
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

Open the notebook in Jupyter:

bash
jupyter notebook Industrial\ Equipment\ Defect\ Detection.ipynb
Run each cell sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, and train the model.
